Description: # assault
        
        A simple CLI load testing tool.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install using `pip`:
        
        ```
        $ pip install assault
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The simplest usage of `assault` requires only a URL to test against and 500 requests synchronously (one at a time). This is what it would look like:
        
        ```
        $ assault https://example.com
        .... Done!
        --- Results ---
        Successful requests     500
        Slowest                 0.010s
        Fastest                 0.001s
        Average                 0.003s
        Total time              0.620s
        Requests Per Minute     48360
        Requests Per Second     806
        ```
        
        If we want to add concurrency, we'll use the `-c` option, and we can use the `-r` option to specify how many requests that we'd like to make:
        
        ```
        $ assault -r 3000 -c 10 https://example.com
        .... Done!
        --- Results ---
        Successful requests     3000
        Slowest                 0.010s
        Fastest                 0.001s
        Average                 0.003s
        Total time              2.400s
        Requests Per Minute     90000
        Requests Per Second     1250
        ```
        
        If you'd like to see these results in JSON format, you can use the `-j` option with a path to a JSON file:
        
        ```
        $ assault -r 3000 -c 10 -j output.json https://example.com
        .... Done!
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        For working on `assult`, you'll need to have Python >= 3.7 (because we'll use `asyncio`) and [`pipenv`][1] installed. With those installed, run the following command to create a virtualenv for the project and fetch the dependencies:
        
        ```
        $ pipenv install --dev
        ...
        ```
        
        Next, activate the virtualenv and get to work:
        
        ```
        $ pipenv shell
        ...
        (assault) $
        ```
